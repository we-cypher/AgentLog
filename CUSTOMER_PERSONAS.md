# AgentLog Customer Personas & Use Cases

*Understanding who uses AgentLog and how they get value from our platform*

---

## 🏢 **Enterprise AI Teams**
*"We need to debug production agent failures and optimize workflows"*

### **Meet Sarah - AI Product Manager at a FinTech Company**

**Her Problem:**
> "Our customer service AI agents are failing 15% of the time, but we have no idea why. When an agent gives a wrong answer or crashes, we just see 'LLM error' in our logs. We need to understand what the agent was thinking before it failed."

**How Sarah Uses AgentLog:**

1. **Production Debugging:**
   - Agent fails → Sarah opens AgentLog dashboard
   - Searches for the failed session by timestamp
   - Sees complete timeline: user input → agent thought → tool calls → failure point
   - Identifies that agent was calling wrong API due to context confusion

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Weekly review of agent performance metrics
   - Identifies patterns: agents struggle with specific customer request types
   - Uses session replay to understand reasoning patterns
   - Optimizes prompts and tool configurations based on real behavior

3. **Compliance & Auditing:**
   - Regulators ask: "How did your AI make this decision?"
   - Exports session data showing complete decision trail
   - Demonstrates AI reasoning was appropriate and followed guidelines

**Sarah's Quote:** *"AgentLog is like having a flight recorder for our AI agents. When something goes wrong, we can replay exactly what happened instead of guessing."*

## 🧑‍💻 **AI Developers** 
*"I need visibility into reasoning patterns to build better agents"*

### **Meet Marcus - Senior AI Engineer at a Startup**

**His Problem:**
> "I'm building a multi-agent system where agents hand off tasks to each other. When the final output is wrong, I can't tell which agent made the mistake or why. Debugging feels like working blindfolded."

**How Marcus Uses AgentLog:**

1. **Development & Testing:**
   ```typescript
   // Marcus adds AgentLog to his agent code
   const agentLog = new AgentLog({ apiKey: 'dev-key' });
   
   // Logs every agent decision
   await agentLog.logAgentThought('User wants product recommendations...');
   await agentLog.logToolCall('database', 'query_products', { category: 'laptops' });
   await agentLog.logAgentOutput('Here are 5 laptop recommendations...');
   ```

2. **Multi-Agent Debugging:**
   - Traces conversation flow between agents
   - Sees Agent A correctly identifies user intent
   - Agent B retrieves wrong data from database
   - Agent C makes decision based on bad data
   - **Result:** Marcus fixes Agent B's query logic

3. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Reviews successful vs failed sessions
   - Discovers agents perform better with specific prompt structures
   - Optimizes agent communication protocols

4. **Integration Testing:**
   - Tests new agent versions against historical sessions
   - Compares reasoning patterns before/after changes
   - Validates improvements actually work

**Marcus's Quote:** *"Before AgentLog, debugging multi-agent systems was like trying to debug a distributed system with no logs. Now I can see exactly how agents communicate and where things break down."*

## 🔬 **AI Researchers**
*"I want to analyze agent behavior and multi-agent interactions"*

### **Meet Dr. Chen - AI Research Scientist**

**Her Problem:**
> "I'm studying how AI agents collaborate and make decisions. Current tools only show me LLM inputs/outputs, but I need to understand the reasoning process and how agents influence each other's behavior."

**How Dr. Chen Uses AgentLog:**

1. **Behavioral Analysis:**
   - Runs experiments with different agent configurations
   - Analyzes thousands of sessions to identify patterns
   - Studies how agent "personality" affects decision quality

2. **Multi-Agent Research:**
   - Tracks how agents negotiate and collaborate
   - Measures information flow between agents
   - Identifies emergent behaviors in agent teams

3. **Academic Papers:**
   - Exports session data for statistical analysis
   - Publishes research on agent decision-making patterns
   - Shares anonymized datasets with research community

4. **Model Comparison:**
   - Tests same scenarios with different LLMs
   - Compares reasoning quality across model types
   - Identifies which models work best for specific tasks

**Dr. Chen's Quote:** *"AgentLog gives me the structured data I need to turn agent behavior from a black box into publishable science. I can finally measure how agents actually think and collaborate."*

## ⚡ **DevOps Teams**
*"We need to monitor agent performance like any other service"*

### **Meet James - Senior DevOps Engineer**

**His Problem:**
> "Our company has 50+ AI agents running in production. When they slow down or fail, it affects our business, but we have no monitoring. I need to treat AI agents like any other critical service."

**How James Uses AgentLog:**

1. **Production Monitoring:**
   - Sets up Grafana dashboards with AgentLog metrics
   - Monitors agent response times, error rates, tool usage
   - Gets alerted when agent performance degrades

2. **Capacity Planning:**
   - Tracks which agents are overloaded
   - Identifies peak usage patterns
   - Plans infrastructure scaling based on agent demand

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Agent service degrades → James gets alert
   - Opens AgentLog to see which agents are struggling
   - Identifies root cause: database latency affecting tool calls
   - Scales database resources to fix agent performance

4. **SLA Management:**
   - Defines SLAs for agent response times
   - Monitors compliance across different agent types
   - Reports on AI service reliability to leadership

**James's Quote:** *"We monitor every other service - APIs, databases, queues. AgentLog finally lets us monitor our AI agents with the same rigor. Now I can treat agents as first-class citizens in our infrastructure."*

# AgentLog Customer Personas & Use Cases

_Understanding who uses AgentLog and how they get value from our platform_

---

## üè¢ **Enterprise AI Teams**

_"We need to debug production agent failures and optimize workflows"_

### **Meet Sarah - AI Product Manager at a FinTech Company**

**Her Problem:**

> "Our customer service AI agents are failing 15% of the time, but we have no idea why. When an agent gives a wrong answer or crashes, we just see 'LLM error' in our logs. We need to understand what the agent was thinking before it failed."

**How Sarah Uses AgentLog:**

1. **Production Debugging:**
   - Agent fails ‚Üí Sarah opens AgentLog dashboard
   - Searches for the failed session by timestamp
   - Sees complete timeline: user input ‚Üí agent thought ‚Üí tool calls ‚Üí failure point
   - Identifies that agent was calling wrong API due to context confusion

2. **Performance Optimization:**
   - Weekly review of agent performance metrics
   - Identifies patterns: agents struggle with specific customer request types
   - Uses session replay to understand reasoning patterns
   - Optimizes prompts and tool configurations based on real behavior

3. **Compliance & Auditing:**
   - Regulators ask: "How did your AI make this decision?"
   - Exports session data showing complete decision trail
   - Demonstrates AI reasoning was appropriate and followed guidelines

**Sarah's Quote:** _"AgentLog is like having a flight recorder for our AI agents. When something goes wrong, we can replay exactly what happened instead of guessing."_

## üßë‚Äçüíª **AI Developers**

_"I need visibility into reasoning patterns to build better agents"_

### **Meet Marcus - Senior AI Engineer at a Startup**

**His Problem:**

> "I'm building a multi-agent system where agents hand off tasks to each other. When the final output is wrong, I can't tell which agent made the mistake or why. Debugging feels like working blindfolded."

**How Marcus Uses AgentLog:**

1. **Instant Trial (30 seconds):**

   ```bash
   # Marcus hears about AgentLog and tries it immediately
   npx @agentlog/local
   # AgentLog dashboard opens at localhost:3000
   ```

2. **Development & Testing:**

   ```typescript
   // Marcus adds AgentLog to his agent code - no API key needed for local
   const agentLog = new AgentLog(); // Auto-detects local mode

   // Logs every agent decision
   await agentLog.logAgentThought("User wants product recommendations...");
   await agentLog.logToolCall("database", "query_products", {
     category: "laptops",
   });
   await agentLog.logAgentOutput("Here are 5 laptop recommendations...");
   ```

3. **Team Deployment:**

   ```bash
   # After proving value locally, Marcus deploys for his team
   git clone agentlog/self-hosted
   docker-compose up
   # Full team collaboration with unlimited sessions
   ```

4. **Multi-Agent Debugging:**
   - Traces conversation flow between agents
   - Sees Agent A correctly identifies user intent
   - Agent B retrieves wrong data from database
   - Agent C makes decision based on bad data
   - **Result:** Marcus fixes Agent B's query logic

5. **Pattern Recognition:**
   - Reviews successful vs failed sessions
   - Discovers agents perform better with specific prompt structures
   - Optimizes agent communication protocols

6. **Integration Testing:**
   - Tests new agent versions against historical sessions
   - Compares reasoning patterns before/after changes
   - Validates improvements actually work

**Marcus's Quote:** _"Before AgentLog, debugging multi-agent systems was like trying to debug a distributed system with no logs. Now I can see exactly how agents communicate and where things break down."_

## üî¨ **AI Researchers**

_"I want to analyze agent behavior and multi-agent interactions"_

### **Meet Dr. Chen - AI Research Scientist**

**Her Problem:**

> "I'm studying how AI agents collaborate and make decisions. Current tools only show me LLM inputs/outputs, but I need to understand the reasoning process and how agents influence each other's behavior."

**How Dr. Chen Uses AgentLog:**

1. **Behavioral Analysis:**
   - Runs experiments with different agent configurations
   - Analyzes thousands of sessions to identify patterns
   - Studies how agent "personality" affects decision quality

2. **Multi-Agent Research:**
   - Tracks how agents negotiate and collaborate
   - Measures information flow between agents
   - Identifies emergent behaviors in agent teams

3. **Academic Papers:**
   - Exports session data for statistical analysis
   - Publishes research on agent decision-making patterns
   - Shares anonymized datasets with research community

4. **Model Comparison:**
   - Tests same scenarios with different LLMs
   - Compares reasoning quality across model types
   - Identifies which models work best for specific tasks

**Dr. Chen's Quote:** _"AgentLog gives me the structured data I need to turn agent behavior from a black box into publishable science. I can finally measure how agents actually think and collaborate."_

## ‚ö° **DevOps Teams**

_"We need to monitor agent performance like any other service"_

### **Meet James - Senior DevOps Engineer**

**His Problem:**

> "Our company has 50+ AI agents running in production. When they slow down or fail, it affects our business, but we have no monitoring. I need to treat AI agents like any other critical service."

**How James Uses AgentLog:**

1. **Production Monitoring:**
   - Sets up Grafana dashboards with AgentLog metrics
   - Monitors agent response times, error rates, tool usage
   - Gets alerted when agent performance degrades

2. **Capacity Planning:**
   - Tracks which agents are overloaded
   - Identifies peak usage patterns
   - Plans infrastructure scaling based on agent demand

3. **Incident Response:**
   - Agent service degrades ‚Üí James gets alert
   - Opens AgentLog to see which agents are struggling
   - Identifies root cause: database latency affecting tool calls
   - Scales database resources to fix agent performance

4. **SLA Management:**
   - Defines SLAs for agent response times
   - Monitors compliance across different agent types
   - Reports on AI service reliability to leadership

**James's Quote:** _"We monitor every other service - APIs, databases, queues. AgentLog finally lets us monitor our AI agents with the same rigor. Now I can treat agents as first-class citizens in our infrastructure."_
